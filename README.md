# Water Sort Puzzle Solver
This project is using some basic AI knowledge to solve "Water Sort Puzzle".

Here we use Python 3.10 to write this project.
### Guide
Firstly, you have to install Python: https://www.python.org/downloads/

In this project, we use argparse module to run in CLI.

If your PC/Mac have not had argparse module, you can install it via command:

``` 
pip install argparse 
```
### How to use

##### The puzzle generator
You can generate a new puzzle via command in this project directory by using:

``` python generator.py xxx xxxx xxxxx.json ```
    
- xxx is the number of bottles.
    
- xxxx is the number of waters in one bottle.
    
- xxxxx is the name of json file in which we save the puzzle.

After generated, the puzzle is saved in the folder 'puzzles'.
